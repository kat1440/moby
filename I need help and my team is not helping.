I don't know the rules to all this, but as I am trying to benefit everyone, I feel like there is an attack underway.
I have an idea it's not my idea I don't know where the idea came from either but the idea is to possibly be able to take the source code from the winning slot machine games and use that to convert it into Bitcoin.
I need help in order to do this I have a really clear idea and how to get it done I just need the help I've tried twice now to do it by myself and I can't do it I don't know if the cards that I gave away had any Bitcoin on them or not.
But I figured and there were a few for about four or five different people that if they were going to work could use those so I gave them away. If somebody could help me get a little insight into how to source code if I can get a team together I have the tools I just I have the tools and I have the start of an idea I have the whole idea I just need somebody I need somebody to help build
